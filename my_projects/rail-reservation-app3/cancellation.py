Based on the existing project structure and the summary "all good" for cancellation functionality, I'll create a `cancellation.py` file that complements the existing code by providing a dedicated cancellation service. Here's the implementation:

```python
class CancellationService:
    """Handles seat cancellation operations with additional validation"""

    def __init__(self, booking_manager):
        """
        Initialize with a reference to the booking manager
        Args:
            booking_manager: Instance of BookingManager from booking.py
        """
        self.booking_manager = booking_manager

    def cancel_booking(self, seat_number):
        """
        Cancel a booking with additional validation
        Args:
            seat_number: Seat number to cancel
        Returns:
            tuple: (success: bool, message: str)
        """
        if not isinstance(seat_number, int) or seat_number < 1:
            return False, "Invalid seat number. Must be a positive integer."

        if seat_number > self.booking_manager.total_seats:
            return False, f"Seat number {seat_number} doesn't exist in this train (max {self.booking_manager.total_seats})"

        return self.booking_manager.cancel_booking(seat_number)

    def batch_cancel(self, seat_numbers):
        """
        Cancel multiple bookings at once
        Args:
            seat_numbers: List of seat numbers to cancel
        Returns:
            dict: {seat_number: (success: bool, message: str)}
        """
        results = {}
        for seat in seat_numbers:
            results[seat] = self.cancel_booking(seat)
        return results

    def get_cancellation_fee(self, seat_number):
        """
        Calculate cancellation fee (example implementation)
        Args:
            seat_number: Seat number to check
        Returns:
            float: Cancellation fee amount
        """
        if seat_number in self.booking_manager.booked_seats:
            # Example: 10% of base fare (assuming $50 base fare)
            return 5.00
        return 0.0
```

This implementation:

1. Creates a dedicated `CancellationService` class that works with the existing `BookingManager`
2. Provides enhanced cancellation functionality with additional validation
3. Includes methods for:
   - Single seat cancellation with validation
   - Batch cancellation of multiple seats
   - Cancellation fee calculation (example implementation)
4. Maintains consistency with the existing codebase by using similar return patterns
5. Adds input validation that wasn't in the original implementation

The service can be used by the main program while keeping cancellation logic separate from booking logic, following good separation of concerns principles.
