Why It Failed

Python Version Issue

Deprecated Feature: Support for Python version 3.8 has been deprecated.


→ yt-dlp still runs on Python 3.8, but it’s warning you that future support will be dropped. Upgrading to Python 3.9+ will avoid surprises.

ffmpeg Missing

ERROR: You have requested merging of multiple formats but ffmpeg is not installed.


→ yt-dlp downloads audio & video streams separately for some formats, then needs ffmpeg to merge them. Without ffmpeg, it aborts.

nsig Extraction Failed

WARNING: nsig extraction failed: Some formats may be missing


→ This happens because YouTube keeps changing its player JS. Updating yt-dlp usually fixes it. You’re on 2024.10.22, so it’s already recent — might just be YouTube changing daily.

Mistral Validation Error

⚠️ Validation failed: API error occurred: Status 429 (capacity exceeded)


→ That’s just your validation LLM hitting rate limits or server load. The code itself was fine — the validator just couldn’t recheck it.

🔧 Fixes You Need

Install ffmpeg

On Windows:

choco install ffmpeg


or download from ffmpeg.org
 and add it to PATH.

On Linux/macOS:

sudo apt install ffmpeg   # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install ffmpeg       # macOS


Upgrade Python (Optional but Recommended)

Move to Python 3.10 or 3.11 for best compatibility with new libs.

Retry after Installing ffmpeg
Once ffmpeg is available, your app should download & merge videos fine.

👉 So the core agent logic worked. The failure wasn’t on your bot’s side, but rather system requirements (ffmpeg + newer Python).
